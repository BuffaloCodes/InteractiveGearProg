    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
        A special thank you to the <a href="https://discord.gg/ironscape" target="_blank">Ironscape Discord
            Community</a> for their support and contributions in refining the sequencing of milestones. I would like to
        acknowledge the following members for their invaluable efforts (in no particular order):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>BoofingWeed</strong>: Did my fire cape back in 2016
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lettuce fuq</strong>: Pioneered black salamander at barrows. The method is too OP, so we try not to
            leak it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>9 Inch Wand</strong>: Developed the “raw entry” method for solo CoX. No prep, no scouting, just
            straight in. Widely regarded as inefficient, dangerous, and strangely intimate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Odablock</strong>: Debunked the once-popular “no gear grind” Ironman build by accidentally equipping
            gear.
            The moment reshaped the early meta and shattered a niche ideology overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gnomonkey</strong>: Unintentionally disproved the “barefoot bonus” movement by wearing boots
            on-stream
            during early-game Agility. The community quietly abandoned the theory overnight.
        </li>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>PregantSonic</strong>: Designed the first documented Slayer block list composed entirely of monsters
            that
            “felt off.”
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Drøgøn</strong>: Provided quality assurance and contributed extensive theorycrafting for new metas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Parasailer</strong>: Author of <em>Parasailer's Gear Progression Chart</em> and co-author of
            <em>BRUHSailer</em>, the comprehensive Ironman account progression guide. The current gear progression
            sequence is largely based on the aforementioned chart and, by extension, <em>BRUHSailer</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Raze</strong>: Assisted with quality assurance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>So Iron Bruh</strong>: Provided quality assurance and co-authored <em>BRUHSailer</em>.
        </li>
    </ul>
